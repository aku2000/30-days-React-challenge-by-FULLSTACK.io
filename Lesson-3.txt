>> Babel is a library for transpiling ES6 to ES5.
>> In order to use ES6, it's best if we transpile our ES6 JavaScript
into ES5 JavaScript to support more browsers.

<script type="text/babel">
-->This signals to Babel that we would like it to handle the execution of the
JavaScript inside this script body, this way we can write our React app using
ES6 JavaScript and be assured that Babel will live-transpile its execution in
browsers that only support ES5.


ReactDOM.render(<what>, <where>)
-->The first argument to ReactDOM.render() is what to render and the second is
where:
-->All React components require at least a render() function.
This render() function is expected to return a virtual DOM
representation of the browser DOM element(s).
