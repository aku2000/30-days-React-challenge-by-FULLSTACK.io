Stateful Components in React ~

>> React does not allow us to modify this.props on our components for good
reason. Imagine if we passed in the title prop to the Header component
and the Header component was able to modify it. How do we know what the
title is of the Header component?

>> It is a bad idea to modify a variable passed to a child component by a parent component.

>> However, sometimes a component needs to be able to update its own state.
For example, setting an active flag or updating a timer on a stopwatch, for instance.
React gives us the ability to hold state in our components.

>> State in a component is intended to be completely internal to the
Component and its children.

>>  Similar to how we access props in a component, the state
can be accessed via this.state in a component. Whenever the state changes
(via the this.setState() function), the component will *rerender*.
