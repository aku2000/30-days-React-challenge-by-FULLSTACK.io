1)JSX: the X is interprted in 2 different ways -
>> JavaScript XML:It allows us to write HTML in React/JavaScript.
>> JavaScript eXtension: is a React extension that allows us to
write JavaScript that looks like HTML.

-->Extension of Ecmascript which allows HTML like code to co-exist with JavaScript/React code.
-->A JSX compiler converts es6 to normal JavaScript which can be run on any web browser.

2)ES5 and ES6:

>> ES5 (the ES stands for ECMAScript) is basically "regular JavaScript." The 5th
update to JavaScript, ES5 was finalized in 2009. It has been supported by all
major browsers for several years. 
>> ES6 is a new version of JavaScript that adds some nice syntactical and
functional additions. It was finalized in 2015. ES6 is almost fully supported by all major browsers, except
a few like Internet Explorer 11.
>> Some cool features added in ES6 version are class keyword, let and const, spread operator (useful in looping through all
proprties of the object), modules, promise(object is either resolved or rejected)etc.
